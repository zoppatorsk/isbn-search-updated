# isbn-search

ISBN-search traverses a web page replacing isbn numbers with links to a libgen search for the isbn number.
Not every textbook can be found online for free, but if the textbook can be found online, it will likely be on libgen.

## Update infromation

* Changed the libgen url to one that is working.
* Changed the manifest to v3.
* Changed code to use const and let instead of var.
* Changed so the links created are opened in a new tab when clicked.
